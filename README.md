# AnimeGAN
General Adversarial Network and Upscaling CNN created in Pytorch to generate Anime Characters. GAN generates 64x64 pixel images which are then upscaled using ESRGAN to 128x128 pixel images.
Original ESRGAN found at https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN. runGAN.py runs the whole GAN and upscaler, and outputs will be found in the ESRGAN/results folder.
